Disasters impact human lives and change functioning of local, and international civic order. The concept of a place becomes central to disaster studies: what types of places and to what degree are impacted? We focus on a specific type of a disaster and place â€“ hurricanes in the Southeast US. The primary goals are 
1) use principal component analysis (PCA) of US Census data to assess social vulnerability of local communities;
2) create a general index of social vulnerability;
3) explore NOAA Historical Hurricane Tracks dataset as a proxy of biophysical vulnerability;
4) study coincidence of highly impacted areas with vulnerable communities.
